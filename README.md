<h1>MLP Live</h1>

This program is intended to simulate an anti-fragile structure meant to detect DDoS attacks. Implemented with two detection systems based on multilayer perceptron structures, the algorith reades live traffic and determines whether the traffic is dangerous or not.



<h2> Installation requirements</h2>

The program is intended to be run on a linux distribution equipped with netifaces, pyshark, pandas, scipy, mysql connector and database, sklearn, keras, tensorflow, mathplotlib, pymouse, blaze and odo.



<h2>Run</h2>

The program is self explanatory allowing the user to choose what they intend to do by running the main program MLPLive. The only separate function not included in the menu is the computation of PCA principal components, which is separated inside retrain Models and would require to be uncommented, if intended to be used.
